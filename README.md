# ApplicationTimeLimiterTerminal

This tool is designed to efficiently set timers on applications you visit. Many times it occurs that you have unknowingly spent an hour doing something wasteful. It is difficult to progress from that negativity, so the best way to have a healthy and productive lifestyle is to learn from your mistakes and not repeat them. This tool can help mitigate those situations before they happen.

This is the terminal version of this application. There are plans to add a GUI in the future, and that repo can be found here: https://github.com/ArmaanCPro/ApplicationTimeLimiter
